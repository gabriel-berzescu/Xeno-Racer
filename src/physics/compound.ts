/**
 * Tyre compounds per track. Every car races on its own road or slick tyres everywhere but on a winter circuit
 * (`TrackInfo.winter`), where all of them run studded winter tyres. The car is fitted once, before it is built:
 * `fitCar(def, track)` gives back the same car with the tyres of the track (the very same object on a road circuit), and everything
 * downstream (the vehicle, the AI driver's speed profile, the steering filter) reads the tyres from the fitted car.
 *
 * Why a tyre and not only a lower surface grip: a studded tyre does not behave like a summer tyre that is merely slippery.
 *   - The friction does not come from rubber keyed into the road but from the studs digging into the snow and the ice, and from
 *     the shear of the snow itself. Both give way gradually, so the force peaks at a larger slip (10 degrees of slip angle against
 *     6-8, a slip ratio of 0.16 against 0.11) and falls off gently afterwards: the car slides without letting go. That is what makes
 *     sideways driving on ice controllable.
 *   - Friction hardly falls with load (the studs bite as hard on a lightly loaded wheel), so weight transfer matters less.
 *   - A softer, taller carcass answers more lazily (a longer relaxation length).
 *   - The compound works across a very wide range of temperatures, and the tread never gets near a summer tyre's window in air
 *     below freezing.
 * The peak friction itself is the tyre's, the same for every car (about 1.1 on dry asphalt, a winter tyre is no sticky summer tyre),
 * a few per cent better for a narrow tyre than for a wide one (more pressure per area, a deeper bite). The surface then takes it
 * to 0.5 on packed snow and 0.4 on ice (src/physics/surfaces.ts).
 * What the studded tyre keeps of the tyre it replaces, because it is the same size of tyre: the radius, the width and the rolling mass, the
 * thermal size (`heatScale`) and the all-terrain trait (`offroad`). The last one is deliberate: a big block tyre with studs still floats on
 * deep snow, so the Mammoth keeps its edge on the powder beside the road; on packed snow and ice (the road, the lake) the trait does nothing
 * and every car is on the same footing.
